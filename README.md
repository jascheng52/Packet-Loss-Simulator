# Packet-Loss-Simulator
  Simulates a  simple network with a dispatcher sending packets information to a destination with routers in between to relay the packets. Each packet requires different amount of time to process at each router, to simulate different sizes, and only one packet can be processed at a time at each router. Packets get loss when all the routers are fully occupied, and packets are sent from the dispatcher. At the end of the simulation, the program reports the total number of loss packets the average time it took for a packet to be sent, and total packets served. The user can change various parameters to affect the simulation.
Simulator.java is the holds the main class
